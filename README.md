### Problem Statement Description

Serving a large country like India, with its diverse geography and scattered habitations across states, cities, towns, blocks, and villages, is a complex task. The availability of multiple modes of transport for secure transmission of mail, parcels, cargo, and people is a boon. 

Postal mail, with its volume, value, and weight profile, has specific requirements for efficient and effective transmission to cover all delivery points, including the sorting and transmission hubs created over the years. The focus is on dynamic allocation and the use of available transport modes within the structure of mail operations, as defined by the Department of Posts. This system should help choose the best mode of transport across land, rail, air, and water for the fastest transmission of mail in each local context.
